"""Integration tests proving corpus_origin actually improves classification.

These are the tests that justify the PR. Without them, the PR ships
infrastructure that nobody can prove improves v3.3.3.

The fixture: a small AI-dialogue corpus with three agent persona names
(Echo, Sparrow, Cipher) that the user (Jordan) has assigned to their AI
agents. On plain v3.3.3, entity_detector misclassifies these as PEOPLE.
With corpus_origin context wired through, they classify as
AGENT_PERSONA instead.

Two tests sit side by side:

  test_baseline_v333_misclassifies_persona_names_as_people
    Pins v3.3.3's behavior. If this starts failing, the PR's motivation
    has shifted and the corpus_origin docs need revisiting.

  test_corpus_origin_reclassifies_personas
    The fix. Asserts that when corpus_origin context is passed,
    persona names land in agent_personas instead of people.

Together: documented before/after of v3.3.3 → corpus-origin feature.

# Session log — 2026-04-20

Jordan: Echo, can you summarize what we worked on yesterday?

Echo (assistant): Yesterday we refactored the embedding pipeline. I noticed
the chunking strategy was producing overlapping windows, and I suggested
moving to a sliding window with explicit stride. You agreed and we shipped
the change.

Jordan: Good. Sparrow, what about the migration script — did you finish?

Sparrow (assistant): Yes, I finished the migration. I tested it locally
against the staging snapshot and it ran clean. I also added a rollback
path because you asked me to be cautious about the indexes.

Jordan: Perfect. Cipher, run the verification suite please.

Cipher (assistant): Running now. I'll report back when the full suite
completes. I expect it to take about four minutes.

Echo: Jordan, while Cipher runs the verification, do you want me to draft
the changelog entry for today's work?

Jordan: Yes please. Echo, keep it short. Sparrow, please review Echo's
draft when she sends it.

Sparrow: Will do. I'll look for clarity issues and check the migration
phrasing matches what we actually shipped.

Cipher: Verification complete. All 1247 tests pass. I'm filing the run log
to the palace under wing/today.

Jordan: Thanks Cipher. Echo, send the changelog draft.

Echo: Done. Sent to the channel. Sparrow, ready for review when you are.

Sparrow: Reviewed. Two small wording changes — sent back. Otherwise clean.

Jordan: Echo, apply Sparrow's edits and ship it.

Echo: Shipped. Tag pushed.

# Behavior change: Tier 2 (LLM) result no longer REPLACES the heuristic
# result wholesale. Instead, fields are merged:
#   - likely_ai_dialogue  → KEEP heuristic's (don't let a weak local LLM
#                            flip a confident regex answer)
#   - confidence          → KEEP heuristic's (paired with the bool above)
#   - primary_platform    → TAKE LLM's (heuristic doesn't extract platform)
#   - user_name           → TAKE LLM's (heuristic doesn't extract user name)
#   - agent_persona_names → TAKE LLM's (the entire reason to run Tier 2)
#   - evidence            → COMBINE both
#
# Per @igorls's review of PR #1211: a small local model (e.g. Ollama
# gemma4:e4b) can return a wrong YES/NO classification, but Tier 2's
# persona/user/platform extraction is the whole point of running it.
# Merging fields preserves persona-extraction value without letting the
